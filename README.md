# Clustering
Two files uploaded,
The first file (k-means.py) is the k-means algorithm implemented in python.
The second file is a preperation steps for the Normalized Spectral Clustering algorithm.
this C code transforms a given file of vectors to a weighted adjacency matrix (W), then computes the normalized graph Laplacian (L norm).
